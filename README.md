# Booking

This was a project that I had to do for university, for my OOP class.
A console app built using C++.
I had to implement some OOP concepts, as it was at the middle of my course and I wasn't too advanced in OOP design patterns or OOP in general.

The app has some hard coded users, and can simulate a Booking-like app that allows said users to book stays at hotels/pensions.
There is one administrator, that when connected has some extra choices like generating statistics, denying stays or accepting them, marking stays as done, adding new units...

The users, reservations and units are kept in memory using a txt file for each, and a master "config.txt" for each category that keeps the name of the other files organised.
